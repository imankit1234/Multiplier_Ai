# **HCP Data Analysis in Databricks**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing** a dataset containing doctor-related information. The data is processed in **Databricks** using SQL and Python, with insights derived through **various visualizations** such as heatmaps, bar charts, and pie charts.  

## **Key Objectives**  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing inconsistencies, standardizing formats, and handling missing values.  
- **Data Transformation**: Extracting relevant information such as experience, locality, and city.  
- **Data Analysis**: Generating meaningful insights on doctor distribution, experience, and specializations.  
- **Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to plot heatmaps, histograms, and pie charts.

## **1. Data Cleaning Steps**  

### **Cleaning Phone and Email Data**  
- Ensuring phone numbers are at least 10 digits long.  
- Ensuring pincode values have at least 6 digits.  
- Replacing missing phone numbers and emails with `"Unknown"`.  

### **Extracting City and Formatting Locality**  
- Converting **locality** values to **Camel Case**.  
- Extracting **city** as the first word before a comma, if present.  

### **Extracting Experience in Years**  
- Extracting numerical values from experience descriptions to standardize the format.

## **2. Data Analysis & Visualizations**  

### **Insights Extracted**  
1. **Doctor Distribution by City and Specialization (Heatmap)**  
   - Visual representation of the number of doctors in each specialization across different cities.  
2. **Doctor Count by Speciality and Experience (Bar Chart)**  
   - Understanding experience levels across specializations.  
3. **Doctor Specialization Distribution (Pie Chart)**  
   - Percentage distribution of doctors among various specializations.

## **3. Tools & Technologies Used**  
âœ… **Databricks** - For data storage, SQL queries, and data transformation.  
âœ… **Apache Spark (PySpark)** - For handling large-scale data efficiently.  
âœ… **SQL** - Used for data cleaning and transformation.  
âœ… **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** - For visualizing insights from the cleaned dataset.

## **4. Future Enhancements**  
ðŸ”¹ **Implement Machine Learning** to predict demand for specializations.  
ðŸ”¹ **More Advanced Cleaning** using NLP techniques for text-based fields.  
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Dashboards** using Power BI or Tableau for real-time insights.
